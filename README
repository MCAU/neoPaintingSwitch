<br><br></span>This plugin uses the same basic idea as located here <a href="http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/inactive-edit-paintingswitch-v0-1-choose-paintings-with-ease-672.5788/">here</a> and <a href="http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/edit-paintingswitch-v0-4-scroll-through-paintings-1185.24604/">here</a>.

<br><br>This plugin was originally created by <a href="http://forums.bukkit.org/members/edward-hand.13332/">Edward Hand</a> (credit to him!) and updated by <a href="http://forums.bukkit.org/members/madmonkeyco.22820/">MadMonkeyCo</a>. However is was abandoned again and because I use it I needed it working. <br>Basically, it simplifies the selecting of paintings and saves alot of time. Permissions are supported.

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Features:</span>
<br><ul><li>Allows you to scroll through paintings by aiming and right
clicking at them and using the mouse wheel to scroll through paintings.</li><li>&nbsp;Permissions support ("neopaintingswitch.use").

</li></ul><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Version 1.0:</span><br><ul><li>First release.
