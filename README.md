neoPaintingSwitch 1.32
=====================

This plugin uses the same basic idea as located [here](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/inactive-edit-paintingswitch-v0-1-choose-paintings-with-ease-672.5788/) and [here] (http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/edit-paintingswitch-v0-4-scroll-through-paintings-1185.24604/).

This plugin was originally created by [Edward Hand](http://forums.bukkit.org/members/edward-hand.13332/) (credit to him!) and also eventually updated by [MadMonkeyCo](http://forums.bukkit.org/members/madmonkeyco.22820/). However is was abandoned again and because I use it I needed it working. Basically, it simplifies the selecting of paintings and saves alot of time. Permissions are supported.

=========
* Allows you to scroll through paintings by aiming and right clicking at them and using the mouse wheel to scroll through paintings.
